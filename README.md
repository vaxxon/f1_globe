# F1 Globe 2025

A map of all the tracks used in the 2025 season along with weather data from that weekend from the beginning of F1 in 1950 to 2025.

This project was built for INFO-609 Intro to GIS at Pratt Institute. You can see it in action at [my website](https://vincentallport.com/f1_globe). It consists of:

- [f1_globe.ipynb](f1_globe.ipynb), a Jupyter notebook that fetches event information and historical weather patterns, and
- [f1_globe/](f1_globe), a simple React app to display the information.

## Project roadmap

- Add weather forecasting to each track.
- Add higher resolution graphs for weather (All time, since 2020, next season, etc.)
- Add predictions for future races based on forecasted weather conditions and driver history.
- Add animations for each type of weather.
