**How does barometric pressure affect races?**

If barometric pressure trends **higher**, F1 teams will benefit from better airflow cooling their engines and providing more downforce to stick the car to the track. If barometric pressure tends **lower**, teams will need to use what little air is available to cool the engine and generate downforce.

At an altitude of 2.2 km (7,200 ft) above sea level, Mexico City's Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is by far the most elevated track on the current F1 schedule. The high altitude of the track means that the barometric pressure is generally lower and fluctuates wildly, and the air is thinner. On one hand, the reduced drag means cars move faster on the straights; on the other hand, drivers need to take curves more slowly since they have less grip on the track. To compensate, teams can open the car’s cooling ducts to increase its air intake, which cools the engine and heats the driver (as air is exhausted into the cockpit).
