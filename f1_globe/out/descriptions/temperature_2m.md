**How does temperature affect races?**

If the weather is trending **hotter**, Formula 1 teams will need to compensate by budgeting more time for pit stops and more money for tires, which are a considerable expense. If the weather is trending **cooler**, Formula 1 teams will need to train to race with less grip and generally faster racing (as opposing teams are likely to deploy soft tires).

All F1 races are a compromise between applying power to the track and optimizing airflow to keep the engine and tires from overheating.

Unlike commercial tires, the tires on Formula 1 cars are smooth and wide to provide the most surface contact with the track. The tires are heated to 100ºC before they are placed on the car so that the rubber will soften and grip the road surface better. However, this means that a hotter tire will disintegrate faster, leading to more pit stops and more debris on the track.

At the start of a race and during a pit stop, teams can choose from three grades of tire, ranging from soft to hard. Soft tires soften faster and disintegrate faster, but they also provide more grip, allowing the car to move faster and handle better. Hard tires are more resilient, but slower and harder to handle.
