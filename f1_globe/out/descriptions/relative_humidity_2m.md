**How does humidity affect races?**

If the weather is trending **more humid**, F1 teams will need to find ways to cool and rehydrate their drivers. If it is trending **less humid**, the drivers will be able to drive longer and sweat less.

Humidity has a negligible affect on the car; its primary affect is on the drivers. The cockpit of an F1 car can reach 60ºC (140ºF), and while this is mitigated by the drivers’ race suits, the extreme humidity of tracks such as the Marina Bay Circuit in Singapore and Autodrómo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City increases the discomfort and dehydration drivers experience.

On the most humid tracks, drivers can lose 3 to 4 liters of sweat over the course of the race. To compensate, they drink energy drinks that replenish hydration and provide a boost during the punishing physical challenge of driving a car at hundreds of kilometers per hour for over an hour.
